#### Licensing
There's no license file yet. That means all rights are reserved to me, so ask me permission to use any code you find here. When I decide how I want to license this project, then I'll add a proper license file. It'll probably be my usual CC 3.0 SA-BY, but maybe not.

#### Features
Nothing, yet! I just started working on this.
